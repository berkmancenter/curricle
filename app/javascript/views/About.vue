      <p class="mb-4">
        Curricle is a platform for course discovery and exploration across the Harvard curriculum. Unlike conventional course management systems, Curricle reveals the curriculum not as a mere listing of courses but as a dynamic network of connections that, like a living organism, evolves over time.

        Curricle is built to promote intellectual inquiry, adventure, and experimentation with the curriculum itself as its living core. It accomplishes these tasks by means of three modes of operation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            EXPLORE offers vivid, intuitive, and interactive data visualizations for highlighting connections among courses, topics, fields, and instructors.
          </li>
          <li>
            SEARCH provides a customizable interface for data-driven keyword search of course descriptions, instructors, and meeting times.
          </li>
          <li>
            PLAN presents a robust set of tools for annotating, organizing, tagging, and annotation tools to planning course of study across weekly, yearly, and multi-year views.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Curricle is not an administrative or enterprise system nor does it intend to replace systems, such as Harvard University's my.harvard, for managing course registration and enrollments. Rather, it complements such enterprise systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The principal target audience of the platform is current students, but Curricle is a multifunctional tool that will be of value also to advisers, faculty, administrative leaders, researchers, parents of students, and even alumni.
      </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            Plan courses of study over the term, the year, and their entire college career
          </li>
          <li>

          HISTORY
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Curricle was launched in 2015, when then-dean of Humanities Diana Sorensen challenged the faculty director of metaLAB (at) Harvard, Jeffrey Schnapp, to lead an effort to envision a course selection tool driven by a liberal-arts spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and intellectual adventure. The project has received strong support from the office of the Division of Arts and Humanities and its current dean, Robin Kelsey, with financial support provided by the Office of the Provost's and the Richard Menschel Fund. The Curricle team is based in metaLAB; its institutional home is in the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.

      <p>
        Thanks are due to members of that team past and present. At Berkman, Financial Director Jon Murley has provided administrative and financial oversight, and Director of Technology Sebastian Diaz has overseen Curricle technical development. At metaLAB, Creative Technologist Jessica Yurkofsky has driven the development of Curricle at every stage; Data Visualization Designer Kim Albrecht has led the design of interactive visualization tools and, with Matthew Battles, Curricle Lens. Senior Researcher Sarah Newman contributed to the project concept and execution as well. Undergraduate interns Maia Suazo-Maler, Snow Dong, Sinead Danaher, and Sydney Lewis, as well as Berkman intern Dash El-Hauge, contributed student perspectives and intellectual energy. Jeffrey Schnapp, Founder and Faculty Director of metaLAB, has provided vision and leadership throughout the project, working closely with Associate Director Matthew Battles, and Project Managers Alexandra Dolan-Mescal (2019-2020) and Oliver Luo (current).
