But even before we get all the way back to the Big Bang, there must have been a time when stars like our Sun or galaxies like our own Milky Way did not exist because the Universe was denser than they are. We therefore face the important question about our origins: how and when did the first stars and galaxies form? Primitive versions of this question were considered by humans in religious and philosophical texts for thousands of years, long before it was realized that the Universe expands. The Seminar will summarize the fundamental principles and scientific ideas that are being used to address this question in modern cosmology. Previous generations of scholars have also wondered about the long-term future of the Universe. For the first time in history, we now have a standard cosmological model that agrees with a large body of data about the past history of the Universe. The Seminar will conclude with the forecast that this scientific model makes about our future. The Seminar will be based on a book with the same title written by Professor Loeb (Princeton University Press, 2010).</p>",0

Although photography has changed this there are still significant differences between the images that most people create and the photographs of leading photographers.&nbsp; The hope is that this seminar will give students the tools to improve their photographs. After a brief review of the historical review of art and photography the seminar will proceed to discuss the components of a modern camera, what the components are and how they work. Topics to be covered include both the physical optics of simple and compound lenses as well as the quantum physics that is the basis of the electronic devices that are fundamental to digital photography. The differences between the RAW, JPEG and TIFF methods for storing digital photographs will be discussed along with artifacts such as the aliasing that can arise in the digitization of images. Exercises will include, amongst other things, how to manipulate images using the open source GIMP software. An essential issue for color photography is the manner in which the human visual system transforms the wavelength information in the light entering the eye into perceptions of color. The seminar will explain the trichromatic theory of color vision and then discuss the management systems for color printing.</p>",0

On land, four kinds of animals produce songs or calls: birds, frogs, mammals, and insects. Some of these (and fish) also do so underwater. The principal sounds such animal species make are signaling behaviors directly related to mating success. They are of individuals, usually males, marking territories, and wooing mates. However, in any one location, species may also compete with one another for occupation of acoustic space (that is, for bandwidth) and otherwise optimize their sound signals to features of their environment. We will explore these topics and others as we listen to and read about each of the various kinds of singers on earth, the biology of their sound production and reception, and the ways they attract mates while avoiding becoming meals for eavesdropping predators. We will listen to many different kinds of acoustic signalers across a wide array of acoustic communities in tropical and temperate settings, both terrestrial and aquatic, and we will examine sound spectra on a large screen as we listen and slow down and isolate sounds to help distinguish their parts. Finally, we will consider the biology and evolution of music in humans, considering evidence from brain studies, archaeology and anthropology, and the music of indigenous peoples. We will look at music parallels in different kinds in animals of other species. There will be field trips to listen to and record assemblages of local species. The overall objective is to awaken the students&rsquo; sense, understanding, and appreciation of the acoustic environment from which we come, and the role of this environment in shaping human biology and culture. There is a fair bit of reading required in preparation for weekly discussions. Accordingly, participation will be expected for discussion of the readings and listening experiences.</p>",0

Using diagramming and mapping processes, both iteratively and speculatively, students will investigate system-environment relationships through the examination of qualities, behaviors, and territories for a select set of urban agents. Each investigation will reveal latent, suppressed, emerging, provisional, and otherwise unmapped connections, which influence the formation of urban spaces, infrastructures, and technologies. Course material is presented through a series of exercises, lectures, workshops, and reviews, which introduce students to the application of foundational design principles and critical design strategies.

The most promising advances in lung biology and respiratory disease are resulting from teams of scientists with diverse disciplinary training, including biology, medicine, engineering, and physics. In addition to a strong foundation in a specific discipline, the ability to recognize and act upon opportunities presented by outside disciplines is a crucial skill. This course is designed to train scientists to approach lung biology and respiratory diseases with an interdisciplinary perspective, in particular by bridging the gap between life sciences and physical/engineering sciences. With a focus on laboratory sciences and on mechanistic levels of understanding, course materials will cover 3 main problem areas: asthma, air pollution, and lung infection. The course consists of weekly course-meetings (lectures and case-studies) plus weekly research seminars from the physiology program. Students will gain skills in recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different disciplinary approaches applied to pulmonary sciences, in designing interdisciplinary experiments effectively, and in interpreting interdisciplinary results critically.</p>",0

In this course, we will critically examine the findings from the new science of happiness, including research in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience and reveal how this work alters our understanding of what happiness is, the optimal ways to achieve and increase it, the role of circumstance in its occurrence, its effect on our physical health, and its place in human nature. We will consider the notion of a biologically determined &ldquo;hedonic set point,&rdquo; and question whether there are people who &ldquo;have started in life with a bottle or two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others seem to have been born close to the pain threshold,&rdquo; as William James noted over a century ago. We will examine how the brain&rsquo;s reward circuitry generates feelings of pleasure, desire, comfort and craving, and the ways it propels us to achieve biologically significant goals. Among the questions we will consider are: What is happiness for? Can one make oneself happier by conscious effort? What are some of the myths about happiness? Finally, is happiness a worthy goal for one&#39;s life? Highlighting the most rigorous and promising work in this field, we will attempt to construct a &ldquo;happiness toolkit.&rdquo; The course will be didactic, interactive and experiential and provide an introduction to a burgeoning field of scientific inquiry.</p>",0

We take the nuances of developmental differences for granted because we&#39;re so accustomed to experiencing them. Nevertheless, defining normal (versus abnormal) development is a complex and controversial task. Development involves a tricky intermingling of environmental stimuli, cultural and social expectations, rapid and not always intuitive changes in brain development, temperamental differences, genetic inheritance, and mind-boggling brain plasticity. The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time. Readings will include classic papers on development, textbook chapters that provide overviews of specific developmental stages, recently published research articles on genetic inheritance, selected contemporary children&#39;s and young adult literature, personal memoirs, and short stories written about childhood.</p>",0

Specific case studies will document the variable conditions that both sustain and challenge designed vegetative morphologies and their mutations: soils and microclimate; adjacencies and ecological connectivity; responses to pathologies and adaptations to climatic change; and administrative management and stewardship.
